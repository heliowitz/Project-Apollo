8/26/2016:
==========
* Fix Google OAuth $http error when called from controller. Fails when route is called from controller, but not from HTML.

- Finished signup/login angular $http logic
    * Look into how to make those routes a bit more streamlined. Can you catch results from calls that aren't called from angular controller, but rather from another Express route?

* Add logout functionality into the profileCtrl

? Investigate to see if we can make the routes more modular

* Add to GitHub


8/27/2016:
==========
> Logout functionality for profileCtrl
> Start doing the routes and functionality for tasks and shit
    > Investigate and see if everything is good for the models

> Github integration

~ Google OAuth error
~ Refactoring routes

? Investigate one-user-at-a-time functionality

- Added logout functionality
    * one user at a time functionality needs to be set from the BE: each instance of the app in a tab resets the userService, might need to update the model


8/28/2016:
==========
> Google auth to look the same as local login
  * Realized that this relies on having the google auth function work from angular $http

> Do routes and functionality for tasks
  > Model investigation

> Github integration


8/29/2016:
==========
- Model investigation seems done, at least for now. Will be using O2M reference between task and user models.
  - Have yet to see how it plays out in displaying....
  * Implement methods that:
    1. Display the tasks for each user
    2. Moves tasks from list to list
    3. Deletes a task
    4. Edits a task
  * Investigate and see if those changes to the BE are immediately seen on angular afterwards... faced this issue before.

* Running into issues with CS authentication... is Passport only for SS authentication?

> Github needs to be linked up tonight, been behind on that...


8/30/2016:
==========
> Implement task methods, and see if anything blows up


9/1/2016:
=========
> Implemented first task method, continue...


9/2/2016:
=========
- Add backlog task method done

> Implement Edit function
> Implement Remove function

> Will require some aesthetic changes to how list is displayed...


9/4/2016:
=========
> Going to add some more factories, each for lists, and one for factory...

> Make add task dialog disappear and appear as needed
  > Then, you can implement the appear/disappear dialog for edits.
  > This will help to determine if it's ok to use the same ng-model for forms of adding and editing


9/8/2016:
=========
> Going to implement edit function for tasks
  - To properly implement the edit function, might be better to try to incorporate it WITH Angular UI modals first...

> Implement the add and remove functions for the other lists as well
> Implement the change list function
  - This might require more separation of the factory: user, then list factories
